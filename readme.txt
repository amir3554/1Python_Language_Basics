These files represent my journey of learning python , during it i have learned about python basics ("variables, if...else, for, while,  statements) operators(<, >,=, not, and, or....)", i have learned about using the cmd and powershell in windows (writing commands) creating a development environments , learning about Data Structures (list, tuples, strings, iterables, sequences, dictionaries, sets list comprehensions) and dealing with them and their functions , integrate them in my small projects to understand the real benefits of them , to be used later in real life applications .

I also learned about the functions in python ( def...return, Argument, parameters, namespace, annotation, lambda functions , recursion, generators and iterators) , all of these are really useful in real life not just in python but in all the programming sector, basically they are a blocks of commands that perform or solve a problem , they can be used anywhere without having to write those command again and again.

the following unit talk about the Programming Paradigms: ( Procedural:(divide the program into a procedures), Object Oriented :( contains classes and their objects, attributes and methods, its one of the most used programming paradigms), functional programming ( it mainly focus on using the functions and its widely used as well), and many others like (logical, event-driven, data-driven, iterative, concurrent, scripting, reactive ....).

And also i have learned about dealing with errors and exception, about Modules, packages and pip (modules manager) in python , which are libraries developed by other engineers to limit the repetition of codes ; for example you don't have to build an entire system (classes attributes and functions) to deal with images , you just install pillow library instead to save you time and create something and creative new using it.

finally i have made a CLI project for managing tasks using all the knowledge that i have gained , in order to consolidate the all those concepts of programming that i have in mind.
